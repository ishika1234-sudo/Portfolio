    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I am a python developer and have been in this profession since a year and half almost. That's not a good amount of time to be
       called as an experienced person, but soon it would be. I completed my Masters in mathematical engineering from
       ICT in 2019. <br><br>
       Exploring new ideas related to my field, solving challenges on popular coding platforms and solving difficulties
       is what I love to do when being professional. I wish to master all the skills as a developer as I keep working
       towards it. Would also love to learn the advanced data science as the time passes by, since one of my final year internships
       was based on it. </p>
